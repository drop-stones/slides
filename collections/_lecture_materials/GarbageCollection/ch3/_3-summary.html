  In this chapter, we discuss solutions to reclaim <em>cyclic data structures</em> in reference count:
  <ol>
    <li>Approaches for functional programming languages</li>
    <li><em>Grouping</em> by programmer</li>
    <li><em>Weak pointers</em> which represent cycle-closing pointers</li>
    <li><em>Hybrid approaches</em> of reference count and mark-sweep</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    However, none of the approaches have been adopted for use by significant systems.
