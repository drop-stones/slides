  <em>Remembered set</em> records inter-generational pointers:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Each entry records the address of the old object which has inter-generational pointers.
      <ul>
        <li>
          A new entry is added if:
          <ul>
            <li>whether a pointer was being stored, and</li>
            <li>whether the pointer is from a old to a young object.</li>
            <!-- <li>whether a reference to a young object was being stored into an old object.</li> -->
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <!--Each object in memory has a bit in its header indicating whether the object is a member of remembered set.-->
      A bit in each object header represents whether the object is a member of remembered set.
      <ul>
        <li>&rarr; No duplicate entries</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Properties</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Costs:
      <ul>
        <li>&plus; No indirection of pointers</li>
        <li>
          &plus; No duplicate entries
          <ul>
            <li>&rarr; Better than <em>entry table</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          &minus; High overhead of store checking
        </li>
        <li>
          &minus; High overhead of scanning large objects
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Slot recording</h5>
  Remembered sets records the address of the slot rather than the object:
  <ul>
    <li>Purpose: To avoid the high overhead of scanning large objects</li>
    <li>
      Two problems:
      <ul>
        <li>"Allow duplicate entries" or "A bit in each pointers"</li>
        <li>
          Multiple entries if the object has multiple pointers
          <ul>
            <li>&rarr; Increase remembered sets size</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
