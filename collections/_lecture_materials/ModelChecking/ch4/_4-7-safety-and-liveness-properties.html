    <h4>Safety Property</h4>

    <p>
      A safety property guarantee that something wrong will never happen.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A safety property is expressed as \( \bm{AG} p \).</li>
      <li>
        If a safety property is violated, there is a finite execution that a "bad" event occurs.
        <ul><li>Counterexample is a path that holds \( \bm{F} \lnot p \). (See <a href="#agp-counter-example">\( \bm{AG} p \)</a>)</li></ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h4>Liveness Property</h4>

    <p>
      A liveness property guarantee that something good will eventually happen.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A liveness property is expressed as \( \bm{AF} p \) or \( \bm{A}(p \bm{U} q) \).</li>
      <li>
        If a liveness property is violated, there is a <em>lasso-shaped</em> counterexample.
        <ul><li>Counterexample is an infinite path that holds \( \bm{G} \lnot p \). (See <a href="#afp-counter-example">\( \bm{AF} p \)</a>)</li></ul>
      </li>
